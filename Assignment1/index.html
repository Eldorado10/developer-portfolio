                            I want to be a Web Developer.That's why I am doing a web development course. “Without a
                            vision,
                            the
                            people perish.” It's the same concept that is sometimes parsed, “If you don't know where
                            you're
                            going, you'll likely end up somewhere else.”</small>

                            set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires your

                    you take it as a compliment.Where there are weaknesses, there are limits. Think about a marathon
                    runner.
                    They won't be able to train very well for a marathon if they can't find a good running stride or
                    have
                    bad
                    nutrition. These are big areas of weakness that just makes training harder. Without correction, your
                    weaknesses will limit how far you can take yourself.

                    My first Easter as a lead pastor saw a standing room only crowd. We had to set up chairs in the
                    foyer
                    and leave the auditorium doors open to accommodate the number of people we had that Sunday.

                    The next year, we were better-prepared…sort of. We decided to do two services on Sunday morning
                    because
                    we were anticipating a similar, if not larger, crowd than the previous year.

                Bangladesh is also discouraging the passengers from South Africa and its surrounding countries to travel
                to Bangladesh. However, if there are passengers from that region, they should be vaccinated with two
                jabs and a Covid-negative test report, he said.

                "The health ministry has instructed 14-day mandatory quarantine for those coming from South Africa and
